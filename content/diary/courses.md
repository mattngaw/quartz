## Foreword

The following is inspired by the many other CMU course reviews out there on the
internet. Just search for `cmu course reviews` on the internet, and you can find pages like this. However, pretty much every other post you will find will be from a CMU SCS 
student/alum.[^1] I have yet to see a course review post from a CMU ECE
student/alum. Maybe this will inspire people to make more! ü§û

[^1]: Here are some of my favorites course reviews: [1](https://fanpu.io/courses/) [2](https://www.ericzheng.org/thoughts/index.html) [3](https://wanshenl.me/courses/reviews/) [4](https://thenumb.at/cmu/)

If you're a current CMU student, I recommend you plan your semesters using ScottyLabs' [CMU Courses](https://cmucourses.com/) tool. You want to have an idea of how many hours your planned coursework will require. Broadly speaking, 40 to 50 hours for one semester is a balanced enough schedule that will leave you enough time for everything in your life other than classes.

If you're a CMU ECE student, I also recommend looking at Professor James Hoe's [advice for CMU ECE undergrads](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~jhoe/doku/doku.php?id=advice_columa), and these [CMU ECE & CS Course Guides](https://github.com/CMU-HKN/CMU-ECE-CS-Guide). I wish I stumbled upon Professor Hoe's advice in my freshman year.

## Key

These emojis act as qualifiers to describe my experience with each class.

- ‚≠êÔ∏è means *transformative*. It gave me a perspective change.
- ‚ù§Ô∏è means I loved the course. I had fun and found it enjoyable.
- üî® means time-consuming. Not necessarily conceptually hard, just lots of work.

Some semesters, especially the earlier ones, are missing these details, mostly 
because I've ~~shut them out~~ forgotten them. The COVID years were 
terrible for me.

- (Research) SPIRAL: Application-Based Fault-Tolerance, Radiation Hardening, Floating-Point

## Fall 2024 (Current)

- (TA) 18-344 Computer Systems and the Hardware-Software Interface

- ‚≠êÔ∏è 17-715 Advanced Topics in Hardware Security (Audit)

## Spring 2024

- ‚≠êÔ∏è üî® [15-411](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~janh/courses/411/24/index.html) Compiler Design (15)

   - Not too challenging conceptually, but it was an engineering nightmare to 
   put together so much code from scratch. By the end of the semester, we were
   able to cobble together a compiler and runtime environment that *in 
   principle* performed [mark-and-sweep garbage collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection#Na%C3%AFve_mark-and-sweep)
   on top of compiling for the [C0 language](https://c0.cs.cmu.edu/docs/c0-reference.pdf).

- [18-341](https://github.com/CMU-HKN/CMU-ECE-CS-Guide/blob/master/electives/18341.md) Logic Design and Verification (12)

   - Took this for extra SystemVerilog practice. I personally did not find verification interesting, but SV has some nifty constructs. 

- üî® [18-500](https://course.ece.cmu.edu/~ece500/projects/) ECE Design Experience (12)

   - My salty, reductionist take on what happened to my team: set ourselves up for
   Icarian failure by choosing a difficult project, failed to get early enough feedback
   to bring us back down to earth, grinded ourselves to the bone just to get something 
   barely working at the end, with lots of busy documentation work throughout.

- 85-241 Social Psychology (9)

- (Research) Application-Based Fault-Tolerance, Radiation Hardening, Floating-Point ($)

**FCE Hours**: 56, was at least 56 (probably more at some points). 

**Workload**: The highest I have ever experienced. This semester there were probably 10ish days where I effectively did not sleep (1-2 hours max, I can't operate with truly zero sleep). Call it cognitive dissonance/justification of effort, but in this semester I feel I learned the most I ever have despite the suffering. I do not regret going through the struggle.

## Fall 2023

- ‚≠êÔ∏è [18-740](https://github.com/CMU-HKN/CMU-ECE-CS-Guide/blob/master/electives/18740.md) Modern Computer Architecture and Design (12)

   - Conceptually interesting. It was the first time I was properly exposed to out-of-order execution. The labs could be a lot better, since I did not gain much insight from them.

- üî® [18-643](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~jhoe/doku/doku.php?id=18-643_reconfigurable_logic) Reconfigurable Hardware (12)

   - On first glance, this class looks like a class on FPGAs and HLS. Much of the lecture content covers those topics, but the labs make this class a hardware design and optimization class in disguise. It was painful to use Vitis HLS, but otherwise I learned a lot about hardware design (a tool-agnostic skill).

- ‚ù§Ô∏è [18-220](https://youtu.be/wfXyBDZX-zw) Electronic Devices and Analog Circuits (12)

   - Fundamental, and Professor Budnik made it incredibly enjoyable.

- 82-137 Chinese Calligraphy: Culture and Skills (9)

   - Fun and chill.

- 66-221 Topics of Law: Introduction to Intellectual Property Law (9)

   - Comically chill. Like, too chill. Like, "should this class even be offered" chill.

- 98-154 Stuco: Intro to Open-Source FPGA & ASIC Chip Design (not registered, just showed up lol)

- (Research) Application-Based Fault-Tolerance, Radiation Hardening, Floating-Point (9)

- (TA) 18-344 Computer Systems and the Hardware-Software Interface

**FCE Hours**: 45, felt like 55

**Workload**: High, mainly because of 643 + TAing + research.

## Spring 2023

- ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è [18-447](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~jhoe/doku/doku.php?id=18-447_introduction_to_computer_architecture) Introduction to Computer Architecture (12)

   - Solidified my love for computer architecture after 344. Built a 2-way superscalar in-order RISC-V core.

- [18-349](https://github.com/CMU-HKN/CMU-ECE-CS-Guide/blob/master/electives/18349.md) Introduction to Embedded Systems (12)

- 79-204 American Environmental History (9)

- ‚ù§Ô∏è 79-211 Modern Southeast Asia: Colonialism, Capitalism, and Cultural Exchange (9)

- (Research) [SPIRAL](http://www.spiral.net/): Modular Arithmetic, [Finite Fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field), and Encryption

- (TA) 18-213 Introduction to Computer Systems

**FCE Hours**: 43, felt like 48

**Workload**: Moderate. 447 became more intense (and fun) at the end. So did 349. The gen-eds balanced out the heavier technicals well.

## Fall 2022

- ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è [18-344](https://course.ece.cmu.edu/~ece344/) Computer Systems and the Hardware-Software Interface (12)

   - Pivotal. This class put me on the path of computer architecture/systems.

- 18-290 Signals and Systems (12)

- ‚ù§Ô∏è [10-301](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/courses/10601/) Introduction to Machine Learning (12)

- 76-270 Writing for the Professions (9)

- 98-043 StuCo: Chess Tactics and Strategy (3)

- (Research) [SPIRAL](http://www.spiral.net/): [FFT Integer Multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_theorem) w/ [Interval Arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic)

- (TA) 18-213 Introduction to Computer Systems

**FCE Hours**: 44, felt like 48

**Workload**: Moderate.

## Spring 2022

- üî® 18-240 Structure and Design of Digital Systems (12)

   - 240 was a struggle for me; It was tedious and laborious. I did not understand how cool hardware could be
   until I got to later courses.

- ‚≠êÔ∏è [15-150](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15150/) Principles of Functional Programming (12)

   - Opened my mind to a different way to program. This class proved useful to me later on
   in both learning Rust and taking Compilers.

- 36-226 Introduction to Statistical Inference (9)

   - Why the heck did I take this class? Wasn't interesting, didn't help me in my degree at all!

- 15-281 Artificial Intelligence: Representation and Problem Solving (12)

- 98-008 StuCo: Shilling The Rust Programming Language (3)

   - My first introduction to Rust. I did not appreciate it as much as I do now because of how tough the other classes were on me.

**FCE Hours**: 50. At this time in my undergrad, I was not ready for 50.

**Comments**: This semester served as a wakeup call for me to reflect on what my priorities are.

## Fall 2021 (first time @ Pitt)

- 36-225 Introduction to Probability Theory (9)

- 21-241 Matrices and Linear Transformations (11)

- 73-102 Principles of Microeconomics (9)

**FCE Hours**: 43, felt like 43

**Workload**: Light/moderate

## Spring 2021 (remote @ home)

* 15-122 Principles of Imperative Computation (12)

- 18-100 Introduction to Electrical and Computer Engineering (12)

- 76-101 Interpretation and Argument (9)

- 21-127 Concepts of Mathematics (12)

**Comments**: My worst semester "at" CMU, and probably the roughest experience I've had.

## Fall 2020 (remote @ home)

- 21-259 Calculus in Three Dimensions (10)

- 15-112 Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science (10)

- 24-101 Fundamentals of Mechanical Engineering (12)

- 39-109 Freshman Seminar: Climate Change (9)

**Comments**: Although I was bummed to be at home, the novelty of Zoom college had not worn out.
