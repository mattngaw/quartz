Having recently finished four years of undergrad study, I find myself wondering what kind of career I want to have. At the moment, I'm not able to decide what exactly I want to work on (even the field of "computer architecture" is too broad of a topic). However, I do have a sense for what *kind* of work I want to  do: research, and hopefully [the great kind](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html).

My current and possibly narrow view of research entails getting a deep 
understanding of a very deep, niche topic and solving problems in that area. 
Importantly, I want to be certain that I enjoy such a deep topic before
committing myself to it.[^1] And that's not to say there haven't been any topics
that I like—most of what I have learned in undergrad has been broad
fundamentals, but more than enough of those shallow topics were interesting to 
me. Rather, I am hunting for the deep topics that I like, and I 
suppose the only way for me to find the deep topics that I can both enjoy and do
great work in is by trying many of them out.[^2]

(Richard Hamming, ["You and Your Research"](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html))

find the solutions. The reading is necessary to know what is going on and what
is possible."

How to do explore deeper topics? This source

Having dipped my toes in some grad classes, I noticed that many of them relied 
on not just the usual lectures, homeworks, and exams, but also on the reading of
research papers followed by an in-class discussion. While reading and discussion
are challenging skills for me, I now see that it is through reading what is at
the boundary of human knowledge that I can develop a deeper understanding, and
so I have made it a priority to read many papers.

## Why papers?

> "Papers [...] are probably one of the densest pieces of text that any human
can read, and you have these researchers, some of the brightest minds in in
these fields, working on new discoveries and publishing these works on
journals that are imposing them restrictions in terms of the number of pages
that they can have to explain a new scientific breakthrough. [...]"

I am also inspired to publish these reviews because of Fan Pu Zeng's [ML paper
summaries](https://fanpu.io/summaries/).
