I'm calling this post a "health" plan because it describes both a workout plan and diet/nutrition plan. I think it's time I formalized planning out my workouts and nutrition by explicitly writing it out. These plans will largely contain workout details—the only notes I might have about nutrition is whether I'm on a bulk/cut/sustain, plus any extraneous details about what I'm eating.

> I've decided to formalize my fall '24 health in writing because of how poorly my summer '24 grind has gone. Granted, both working-out and eating well have been harder due to some extenuating circumstances and troubles that I've been having (namely living alone, far from home, in a city that I'm not familiar with, without a car). I'm hoping to do a reset in the next season, where I'll be back at school and in an environment that I'm comfortable with.

## Workouts

The purpose of this season is to make both cardio gains and strength gains. This past summer I haven't really gotten better at anything, I think I've really only sustained. It's hard to make gains without comparing against hard measurements, so I'll be listing some numbers later on.

I think on the strength-side of things, I've been enjoying lifting less as well as feeling my lifts less due to the monotony of my current lifting mindset. I'm aiming to get stronger this season. On the cardio-side of things, I'm only aiming for consistency. Nothing else to it, really.

### Shaking Up My Lifts

I think if I set some concrete goals for myself this season, I'll have more fun with my lifts—making [pressure a privilege](https://youtu.be/AncMbHY6b2A?feature=shared&t=49), not a burden. To write my goals, I'm choosing a few muscle groups and exercises to focus on. I can't list goals for every exercise, but the idea is that if I'm achieving excellence in big compound movements, I'll have holistically improved in most of muscles. Also note that I'm focusing on improving my working sets rather than 1RM.

1. **Bench (Chest)**
	* **Today.** I've been doing 4x185 for working sets, and I consistently fail to finish these sets (3rd/4th sets I typically only get 6-8 reps rather than 8). On dumbbell bench, I'm doing 4x80 mostly consistently.
	* **Goal.** For barbell: 4x185 easily, 4x195 on a good day. For dumbbell: 4x85 consistently.
1. **Pullups (Upper Back)**
	1. **Today.** On a good day, I can do 4x10, maybe even more. I'm not sure how to push myself even further, I think I'd rather go up in "weight" rather than reps, but I don't have my own pullup/dip belt. So I think I'll have to start relying more on the lat pulldown machine. I think I'm able to do 4x8 @ ~185 on a pulldown machine.
	2. **Goal.** Break 200 for reps? This should translate into more powerful pullups.
2. **Squats (Quads/Glutes)**
	1. **Today.** I'm able to do 4x8 @ 275 with a belt. I've been kinda stuck at this weight for a while (maybe a year or so). I'm not sure what needs to change in my training, it might simply just be the frequency of my quad training.
	2. **Goal.** 4x8 @ 295 with a belt. 4x8 @ 275 without.
3. **Deadlifts (Lower Posterior Chain)**
	1. **Today.** Unlike squats, I've made better progress on deadlift over the past few years. Today, I can deadlift 4x6 @ 365, probably 4x8 @ 335 (I don't usually do 4x8 for deadlift).
	2. **Goal.** 4 plates for reps would be sick, but maybe unrealistic. Probably 4x6 @ 385.

So to summarize my fall lifting goals:
1. **Bench**. BB 4x8 @ 195, DB 4x8 @ 85
2. **Lat pulldown**. break 200 for 4x8
3. **Squat**. 4x8 @ 295
4. **Deadlift**. 4x6 @ 385

### Running Plan

With all this lifting, it'll be hard to get running in. Good days for running are Saturday and Sunday, since I should have more time to get both a lift and run in. With this, I should be able to get at least 2 runs in in the week—granted, they aren't very spaced out. Because of this, I think **3 runs a week** is a good target. Of course, if I want I can fit in more.

With two weekend runs and at least one run in the middle of the week, probably Tue/Wed/Thu, I'll likely have one long (zone 2) run, one tempo/workout run, and one easy run.

### Schedule

Here's my tentative workout schedule. At the time of writing, I'm about a month out from locking in this plan, so the details might change.

|       | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | Sunday |
|-------|--------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|----------|--------|
| Lifts | Legs A | Push A  | Pull A    | Legs B   |        | Push B   | Pull B |
| Runs  |        | Easy    |           | Easy     |        | Workout  | Long   |

This plan is definitely subject to change, based on scheduling constraints that will show up from the upcoming semester. But the volume is pretty much decided on.
