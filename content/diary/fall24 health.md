I'm call this post a "health" plan because it describes both a workout plan and diet/nutrition plan. I think it's time I formalized planning out my workouts and nutrition by explicitly writing it out (and making it public). This is something that I've previously done—only informally and somewhat consistently—in the back of my mind, but I never wrote it out. These plans will largely contain workout details—the only notes I might have about nutrition is whether I'm on a bulk/cut/sustain, plus any extraneous details about eating.

> I've decided to formalize my fall '24 health in writing because of how poorly my summer '24 grind has gone. Granted, both working-out and eating well have been harder due to some extenuating circumstances and troubles that I've been having (namely living alone, far from home, in a city that I'm not familiar with, without a car). I'm hoping to do a reset in the next season, where I'll be back at school and in an environment that I'm comfortable with.

## Workouts

The purpose of this season is to make both cardio gains and strength gains. This past summer I haven't really gotten better at anything, I think I've really only sustained. It's hard to make gains without comparing against hard measurements, so I'll be listing some numbers later on.

I think on the strength-side of things, I've been enjoying lifting less as well as feeling my lifts less due to the monotony of my current lifting mindset. I'm aiming to get stronger this season. On the cardio-side of things, I'm only aiming for consistency. Nothing else to it, really.

> 1. Prioritize strength and hit my lift, but more importantly...

### Shaking Up My Lifts

I think if I set some concrete goals for myself this season, I'll have more fun with my lifts—making [pressure a privilege](https://youtu.be/AncMbHY6b2A?feature=shared&t=49), not a burden. To write my goals, I'm choosing a few muscle groups and exercises to focus on. I can't list goals for every exercise, but the idea is that if I'm achieving excellence in big compound movements, I'll have holistically improved in most of muscles.

1. **Bench (Chest)**
	* **Today.** I've been doing 4x185 for working sets, and I consistently fail to finish these sets (3rd/4th sets I typically only get 6-8 reps rather than 8). On dumbbell bench, I'm doing 4x80 mostly consistently.
	* **Goal.** For barbell: 4x185 easily, 4x195 on a good day. For dumbbell: 4x85 consistently.
1. **Pullups (Upper Back)**
2. **Squats (Quads/Glutes)**
3. **Deadlifts (Lower Posterior Chain)**

### Schedule

Here's my tentative workout schedule. At the time of writing, I'm about a month out from locking in this plan, so the details might change.

|-------|--------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|----------|--------|
| Lifts |        |         |           |          |        |          |        |
| Runs  |        |         |           |          |        |          |        |
