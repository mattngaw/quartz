title: The Revival of Team Fortress 2
---
Team Fortress 2 has a special place in my heart. It was my first first-person shooter game growing up, and it is the game with the most hours played in my Steam libraryâ€”1,626 hours at the time of writing. The only other game that comes close (and likely surpasses) is Minecraft, which deserves its own essay at some point in the future.
