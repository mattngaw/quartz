I'm Matt. I am a grad student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) pursuing a M.S. in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/). I recently graduated from CMU with a B.S. in ECE. I am interested in computer architecture and systems. You can find my CV [here](./mattngaw-cv.pdf), and if you are interested in the classes I took at CMU, look [[courses|here]].

This site is my [hypertext garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought), where among the growing plants you can find:

* [[notebook/index|A spiral-bound notebook]]
* [[diary/index|A leather diary]]
* [[papers/index|A messy stack of papers]]

You'll notice that all of my notes and paper reviews are available to all. Knowledge should be [[open-source|open-source.]]

There are many things I enjoy doing in my free time, roughly in order of my current interest and time commitment: lifting, running, playing video games, watching anime, hiking, playing basketball, and [playing chess](https://lichess.org/@/skylake02).

In terms of video games, I've recently been playing Apex Legends, Hades, and Rimworld.

Some shows I have been watching: Jujutsu Kaisen, Rick and Morty.
