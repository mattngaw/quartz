## Background Context

FPGAs are known to provide orders-of-magnitude speedup to compute while also being more energy efficient than CPUs.[^1] If they're so great, why then are not they more widely deployed? This paper argues that it is because of the design effort required to program an FPGA, specifically the design of data movement and memory interfacing.
