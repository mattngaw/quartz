### Briefly, what is this paper about?

This paper is meant to be a "foundational paper" in neuromorphic computing, specifically for temporal/spiking neural networks.

### Strengths? What does this paper contribute? Be brief.

A description of "space-time" algebra. First, a description of how a space-time signal is encoded is givenâ€”via spikes at different time intervals relative to the first spike. The paper argues that such an encoding method is efficient.

Implementation of spiking neural networks using space-time algebra

General applications of space-time algebra

### Weaknesses? What are the flaws? Be brief.
