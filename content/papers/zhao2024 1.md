## Background

### Steps of a side channel attack

1) Co-locate the attacker with the victim on the same physical host.
2) Monitor victim's execution through side channels to extract sensitive information.

### FaaS (Function-as-a-Service)

- A cloud computing paradigm where an application is broken up into multiple **functions**
- The execution details of a function are managed entirely by the platform
	- Run when, where, on what device?
- Functions execute separately and coordinate work by communicating with each other
- Functions are packaged with their dependencies into **containers**
	- Ensures consistent execution across various environments
- There is a **platform orchestrator** that manages the functions
	- Again when, where, on what?
- A FaaS platform makes use of **autoscaling** to dynamically adjust the number of instances of a function based on its demand
- The orchestrator uses several heuristics when searching for a host on which to place a function instance
	- System requirements, resource utilization, load balancing, affinity/anti-affinity
		- Affinity tries to place functions that frequently communicate with each other on the same host
		- Anti-affinity tries to distribute functions across different hosts for fault tolerance

### Sandboxing

- A security mechanism that isolates a program from the rest of the system
- Prevents the program from affecting the system outside of the designated environment
- Limits the scope of impact if the program turns out to be malicious

### Google's Cloud Run Platform

- Google Cloud's implementation of a FaaS platform
- Offers two different types of sandboxed execution environments
	- **Gen 1**. Relies on *gVisor* (a userspace kernel). Lightweight, faster start-up.
	- **Gen 2**. Uses full virtual machines. Heavier, but faster in steady-state.

### Timekeeping

- This paper makes use of the timestamp counter (TSC) to keep track of time.
- "Generally, TSC is synchronized among cores across sockets on Intel platforms."
- A timestamp counter is **invariant** if it resets to zero at boot and increments at a fixed rate
	- Increment rate should be separate from CPU frequency (even ignoring DVFS)

### The Paper

**Goal**: To provide "the first comprehensive study on **risks** of and **techniques** for co-location attacks in public cloud FaaS environments."

The paper demonstrates their techniques on top of the Cloud Run platform.

## Three Main Points

### 1. Threat Model

**Attacker's Goal**. Co-locate with instances of a victim's service on a public FaaS platform (from there it is assumed the attacker can use traditional side channel attack methods).

**Assumptions**:
1. Victim processes sensitive data, e.g. login service, authentication.
2. Attacker can somehow (directly/indirectly) invoke the victim service via a public interface.
3. Once co-located, the attacker can detect when the victim service is running and extract sensitive information.
4. Attacker is unprivileged, just another standard user of the FaaS platform.
5. The public FaaS platform can be trusted.
6. The attacker does not know the exact host selection policy, can only guess through observation.

### 2. Fingerprinting

To be able to identify which host a service is running on, the paper makes use of two architectural features:

1. The [`cpuid` x86 instruction](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/cpuid) to gather processor information and
2. `rdtsc` and `rdtscp` to gather timestamp counter values

The paper uses a combination of processor model and the host boot time to fingerprint a Gen 1 hosts.

The paper calculates boot timestamp $T_\text{boot}$ using the following equation.

$$
T_\text{boot} = T_\text{w} - \text{tsc} / f
$$

Here, $\text{tsc}$ is a measurement made by `rdtsc`/`rdtscp`, $T_\text{w}$ is a real-world time measurement, and $f$ is the TSC frequency in Hz. This method requires that the TSC be invariant. The $f$ varies by machine, and can be obtained using one of two ways.

1. **Using the Reported $f$**. The reported TSC is close, but usually deviates from the actually frequency by some constant. Even just a tiny error can cause measurements to drift as the error accumulates.

2. **Measuring $f$**. This can be done by simply measuring $\text{tsc}$ and wall-clock time twice, using the slope as the TSC clock rate.

### 3. Co-locating

With the ability to fingerprint hosts (and thus the ability to verify if two services are co-located), the paper describes methods for putting two service instances on the same physical host.
