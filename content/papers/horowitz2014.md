## Background

**Context**: The world expects computers to improve every year.  

**Problem**: Continuing to scale performance via “traditional” methods is bottlenecked by power/thermal.

- Using more transistors
- Increasing clock frequency

## Four Main Points

### Non-Solution #1: More Moore

### Non-Solution #2: Thread-Level Parallelism

### Solution #1: Optimizing Data Movement

### Solution #2: Hardware Specialization

## Biggest Weakness



## Conclusions for Future Work
