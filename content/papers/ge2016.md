Because this paper is more of a survey than a conventional paper on a novel idea, I'm following a different format. This paper focuses on microarchitectural timing attacks.

## Channels

- **Side channel**. Unintentional leakage of sensitive information by a victim entity.
- **Covert channel**. Intentional transfer of information between two (potentially malicious) entities.
- **Storage channel**. A method of transferring information by modifying system state.
- **Timing channel**. A method of transferring information by affecting the timing of events in a

## Relevant Microarchitecture

- **Cache**. Cache line, associativity, cache hierarchy, virtual vs. physical addressing
- **Multicore**. Shared caches.
- **Memory controllers**. Memory bandwidth[^1].
- **Interconnect**. Bus, NoC.
- **Hardware multithreading**. SMT, hyperthreading, multiple execution contexts.

[^1]: Memory bandwidth is underprovisioned. The greatest possible load/store bandwidth that can be generated by all the cores is less than what is actually available.

## Sharing Hierarchy

## Attack Taxonomy

Known uarch timing attacks can be organized in a 2D matrix, with level of concurrency on the x-axis and level of sharing on the y-axis.

1. **PRIME+PROBE**. Attacker *primes* the cache with its own cache lines. Victim executes. Attacker *probes* to see if its cache lines were evicted. If so, then the victim touched the same lines, meaning itâ€™s using the same set.
2. **FLUSH+RELOAD**. Attacker *flushes* a shared cache line of interest. Victim executes. Attacker reloads the line while measuring the latency, which reveals whether or not the victim touched the line (and brought it into the cache).
	* Relies on shared virtual memory.
3. **EVICT+TIME**. Attacker causes victim to execute and times the execution. Attacker evicts a cache line of interest. Attacker runs victim and times again. A variation in timing indicates that the victim uses the cache line.
4. **Covert Channel Techniques**. PRIME+PROBE can be used to send messages between two parties encoded through memory access time.
5. **Denial of Service**. Attacker can compete for resources in the system, degrading performance for the victim.
