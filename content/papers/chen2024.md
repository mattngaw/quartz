## Background

This paper studies [[data memory-dependent prefetchers]] (DMPs) as a novel microarchitectural attack surface that is not defended by constant-time programming, the traditional countermeasure against microarchitectural side channel attacks.

The paper reverse-engineers a DMP in a real-world implementation, namely Apple's M1 microarchitecture.

The paper then uses its observations to demonstrate multiple end-to-end attacks using DMPs, even with traditional side-channel countermeasures enacted.

### Threat Model

Assumes a typical microarchitectural attack scenarioâ€”victim and attacker are co-located processes on the same machine.

## Three Main Points

### Reverse-Engineering the M1's DMP

#### Access Patterns
