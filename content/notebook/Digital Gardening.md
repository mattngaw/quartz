I've recently come across this notion of a *digital garden*, and I think it aligns perfectly with my personal belief that my learning and knowledge should be [[open-source]]. I've done a lot of reading[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5] on digital gardens, so I'll be summarizing what I've learned into my own personal ethos for digital gardening.

## My Tenets for Digital Gardening

1. **Public and open**. I do this writing for myself, but others might stand to gain something from reading my writing. I might learn from others who respond to my writing, too.
2. **Links everywhere**. Aggressively connect related thoughts. All links should be bidirectional.
3. **Continual growth.** Posts need not be stuck in the past. They can be revisited and updated.[^6] It may help to make the date be the update date, rather than initial date.
4. **Natural imperfection**. It's okay to put something out there that isn't perfect. Publishing something imperfect is more valuable than not publishing at all in an effort to make the thing perfect.
5. **Casual and fun**. Write in my own voice. It can be [goofy](https://br.ifunny.co/picture/it-s-totally-ok-to-let-na-your-goofy-side-8FGqYWa49?s=cl).
6. **Citations and references**. When possible, cite where my information came from, especially if isn't "common knowledge" (context-heavy[^7]).
7. **Confidence and uncertainty**. Try to attach confidence levels to statements made with my own knowledge. Don't mislead people by always stating things in a confident, factual tone.

[^6]: Even these tenets can be revisited and updated.
[^7]: How a typical superscalar out-of-order processor works isn't common knowledge. But if the overall context of a piece of writing is about processor design, then I shouldn't need to cite every little fact I state about processors.
