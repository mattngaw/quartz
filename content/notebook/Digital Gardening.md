2. **Continuous Growth.** There need not be any final version of a page. They can be revisited and edited further. Conventional blogging and publishing enforces learning and writing in private, until a final product is ready. Gardening opens up the process, allowing visitors to see my learning unfold.
3. **Imperfection & Learning in Public.** Be okay with imperfection in my pages. It helps to tag pages to denote their level of maturity (seeds, saplings, evergreens). Dates for when a page was planted as well as last tended to can help a visitor understand for how long a page has been worked on. It might also be helpful to cite where the knowledge in my notes come from, how confident I am in them, and how much effort I put into the notes.
4. **Playful, Personal, and Experimental**
