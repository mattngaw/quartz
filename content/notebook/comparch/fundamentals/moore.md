A prediction made in 1965 by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore.

States that the number of transistors in integrated circuits would double every two years.

**More interesting**: Also predicts that the cost per component would generally trend downward over time.

**Some observations**: 
* For the average IC manufactured in any given year, there is a local minimum of cost per component.
	* This local minimum trends downwards with time.
* Around the local minimum, there are less cost effective ICs.
	* To the left of the minimum, manufacturing capabilities are underutilized.
	* To the right, manufacturing capabilities are "pushed to the limits", also making the IC more expensive per component.
