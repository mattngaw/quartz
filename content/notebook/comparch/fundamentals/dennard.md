Observation in 1974 by IBM researcher Robert Dennard.

States that as transistors shrink, power density stays the same.

In other words, for fixed amount of chip area, number of transistors will increase as their size decreases, but power consumption for the same area will stay the same.

In reality, this has not held due to poor scaling of leakage current.
