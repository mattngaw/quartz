> "Fish," he said, "I love you and respect you very much. But I will kill you dead before this day ends." (52)

Unfaltering resolve, but also the highest respect for nature.

> He could feel the steady hard pull of the line and his left hand was cramped. It drew up tight on the heavy cord and he looked at it in disgust. "What kind of a hand is that," he said. "Cramp then if you want. Make yourself into a claw. It will do you no good." (58)

Separating the mind from the body. The body is the expression and extension of the mind.

> But, thank God, they are not as intelligent as we who kill them; although they are more noble and more able. (63)

Again, respect for other creatures.

 > The thousand times that he had proved it meant nothing. Now he was proving it again. Each time was a new time and he never thought about the past when he was doing it. (66)

Always striving to be the best I can be, no matter how much I've achieved in the past.

> I must hold his pain where it is, he thought. Mine does not matter. I can control mine. But \[the fish's\] pain could drive him mad. (88)

"Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional."

> “But man is not made for defeat,” he said. “A man can be destroyed but not defeated.” (103)

Defeat is in the mind.

> "Fish that you were. I am sorry that I went too far out. I ruined us both. But we have killed many sharks, you and I, and ruined many others." (115)

A reminder of how the story ends. Greatness is in the struggle itself, not what you bring home to show off.
